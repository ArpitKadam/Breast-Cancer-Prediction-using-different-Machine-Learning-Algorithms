## Project Overview
This project involves using machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation to identify the best-performing model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to breast cancer cell nuclei, extracted from digitized images. The target variable is the diagnosis, which can be either malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage
### Clone the repository:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ArpitKadam/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-different-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
 
## Modeling
The project explores several machine learning algorithms, including:

#### Logistic Regression
#### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
#### Decision Trees
#### Random Forests
#### Gradient Boost Classifier
#### XGB

Each model is trained and tested on the dataset, with hyperparameter tuning where applicable.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

#### Accuracy
#### Confusion Matrix
#### Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## Results
The results indicate the effectiveness of different models in predicting breast cancer. The model with the highest accuracy is selected as the best predictor for this dataset.
